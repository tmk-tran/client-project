# PSG Admin Dashboard

This is an admin dashboard for the Preferred Savings Guide based in Fargo, ND. Admin users will be able to log in, add, delete, and edit organizations and groups that host fundraisers. The fundraisers track the books requested, sold, checked back in, as well as money received and outstanding balance. This is the first step in a bigger project to digitize part of their coupon book to cut costs and be less paper waste for the enviorment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This project should be able to run in your favorite IDE. I used VS code while building it.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

1. Fork the repository
2. Copy the SSH key in your new repository
3. In your terminal type... `git clone {paste SSH link}`
4. Navigate into the repository's folder in your terminal
5. Open VS Code (or editor of your choice) and open the folder
6. In the terminal of VS Code run `npm install` to install all dependencies
7. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:

```
SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
```

While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning. 8. Create a database named `psg_project` in PostgresSQL
-If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `psg_project` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js` 9. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables that you need, as well as mock data to test the app. Copy and paste those queries in the SQL query of the database. If this is going to production, leave out the mock data. 10. Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql` 11. Run `npm run server` in your VS Code terminal 12. Open a second terminal and run `npm run client` 13. Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Database Configuration

- For this project, we created a database using Postico 2
- If you would like to create a database using mock data, please review the database.sql file
